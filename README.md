## ‚òïÔ∏è Project Goals

AI Interview Coach was built to address a common problem: interview anxiety and lack of preparation. Many candidates struggle to structure answers or get flustered under pressure.

This app helps you:

- Practice in private before facing real panels  
- Learn how to tackle behavioral questions effectively  
- Receive structured, repeatable feedback  
- Build confidence by speaking answers aloud

## üí¨ Features

- **Job Description‚ÄìDriven Interviews**: Paste any job description ‚Äî technical or non-technical ‚Äî and the app generates tailored behavioral and technical questions aligned with the role.

- **Voice-First Experience**: Speak your answers aloud using your microphone. The app transcribes your speech in real-time using **Whisper** and responds to you via audio using **gTTS**.

- **AI Feedback in Real Time**: After you answer, **Gemini** evaluates your response and gives feedback on clarity, relevance, structure, and overall delivery ‚Äî just like a real interviewer might.

- **Difficulty Modes**: Choose **Beginner**, **Intermediate**, or **Advanced**. The complexity of questions scales with your selection, making the app suitable for all experience levels.

- **Streamlit-Powered UI**: Fast-loading, mobile-friendly interface with minimal clicks, simple navigation, and smooth interaction between voice, feedback, and controls.
